Hacks in this repository:

__away-recording__ - Integrate Unifi Protect With SmartThings presence detection to only record camera events when I'm away from home or asleep.

__camera_poe_ctl__ - Power off my interior cameras when SmartThings says someone is at home.  Power the cameras back on when everyone is gone.

__openvpn-udm__ - Configure OpenVPN on the UDM as a VPN server for remote clients

__on_boot.d__ - the scripts I use with boostchicken's [on-boot-script utility](https://github.com/boostchicken/udm-utilities/tree/master/on-boot-script) to do custom setup when the UDM reboots.
