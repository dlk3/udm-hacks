Hacks in this repository:

__away-recording__ - Integrate Unifi Protect With SmartThings presence detection to only record camera events when I'm away from home or asleep.

__camera_poe_ctl__ - Turn on/off PoE power on a Unifi switch port that is connected to a Unifi camera

__openvpn-udm__ - How to configure OpenVPN on the UDM as a VPN server

__ntopng-udm-fedora__ - Run the ntopng Network Traffic Monitoring tool on the UDM.  This is my recreation of [tusc's ntopng-udm podman container](https://github.com/tusc/ntopng-udm) using Fedora and including a number of "improvements."

__on_boot.d__ - the scripts I use with boostchicken's [on-boot-script utility](https://github.com/boostchicken/udm-utilities/tree/master/on-boot-script) to do custom setup when the UDM reboots.
