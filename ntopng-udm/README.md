# Running NTOPNG On The Unbiquiti ream Machine Pro (UDM-Pro)

This repository contains the script that I use to generate Debian package files that can be used to install and run the ntopng network traffic analysis tool on a Ubiquiti Dream Machine Pro router/switch.

With the release of Unifii OS v2.4.27 on UDM devices, ntopng can now be run natively.  A podman container is no longer required.

The packages generated by this script are distribued through a PPA repository that can be used by the `apt` command on the UDM to install them.  See [this page](https://dlk3.github.io/udm-hacks-repo/README.ntopng.html) more information.
