# Turning UDM Protect cameras on and off based on SmartThings' location status

For privacy reasons we want to keep our indoor Protect cameras turned off unless nobody is home and the house is empty.  The script in this package turns on our cameras when we are away and turns them back off when we arrive back home.

This project contains the files that I used to build a Debian package that I host in my PPA repository that i9nstalls this script.   Please go to [this page](https://daveking.com/udm-hacks/camera_poe_ctl.html) for more details on using that package.
